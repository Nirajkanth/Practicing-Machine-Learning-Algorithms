# Practicing-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
In this repository I have added ML algorithm that I practiced myself 

1. Data Preprocessing 

  Data preprocessing is crusial thing in machine learning as real world data generally contains noise, missing values or data could be in unusable format.\
  Used Libraries:
  
           1. Sklearn
           2. Pandas
